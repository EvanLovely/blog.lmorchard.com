TL;DR: The open web is beautiful. There's nothing else like it. It's up to you what you do with it. Many folks are doing terrible things with it and ruining it for the rest of us.

## Digital sensawunda

I was [newly digital in 1983][newlydigital]. I missed the era of punch cards - but I was around for 8-bit, floppy disks, [magazine type-ins][typeins], and screechy 300 baud modems.

Eight years later, my networked reach was still limited by area codes to about as far as I was allowed to drive a car. That said, driving to a [copyparty][] organized on the local BBS was the [high bandwidth option][carbandwidth].

[copyparty]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copyparty

[carbandwidth]: https://www.google.com/search?q=never+underestimate+the+bandwidth+of+a+station+wagon+full+of+tapes&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8

In late high school, I read [Zen and the Art of the Internet][zen]. By college, I had mastered email and Usenet and FTP and Archie. I was downloading Commodore Amiga software [from Sweden][aminet]. Holy crap.

And then, sometime in 1993, I heard about this World Wide Web thing. It was **way** better than [Gopher][]!

We had [3270 terminal][3270] access in the libraries to an [IBM 3090][3090] mainframe, and I figured out how to access a text-only browser installed there. Occasionally I could get on a NeXT machine in the comp sci lab with [this Mosaic browser on X11][mosaicx11]. Later, I got dial-up internet access on my Amiga and had [a browser][amigabrowser] working there. My Sophomore year, the Windows lab machines got installed with [Netscape Navigator][].

I knew this thing was going to be a big deal - and that was before JavaScript or CSS - or hell, [even before the `<img>` tag][imgtag]! I started telling everyone I knew. I think that got annoying for everyone I knew.

## The beauty of the open web

Man, I love the web.

It's easy to take this thing for granted, but take a step back and consider it: You've got this thing called a [browser][]. It acts as an [Agent][] on your behalf, reaching out to computers on the Internet and requesting resources identified via [Universal Resource Locators][url]. Looking among these resources, you'd find [hypertext][], [style sheets][], and [multimedia][].

[url]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator
[browser]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser
[agent]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent
[hypertext]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext
[style sheets]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_(web_development)
[multimedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia

Your browser comes pre-installed with code that knows what to do with common types of content. But, browsers can't anticipate every invention. So, one of the supported resource content types is [JavaScript][]. This is a *meta* content type - it offers the ability to augment existing content types and support completely new ones.

[javascript]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

Chew on *that* awhile: Not satisfied to be just a networked document viewer with a frozen set of features, browsers ship with a rich [toolchain][] for running code from the outside world on demand. Kind of scary, but it works way better than any reasonable person should expect.

[toolchain]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain

And again, thanks to the Internet, these resources can each come literally from anywhere (even Sweden!), hosted by any person or company or organization. Your browser chases URL references and collects all these disparate resources automatically. It assembles them into what is basically a fresh, zero-installation software application that's temporarily resident on your computer.

We call these insane things "web pages". Oh, and by the way, and the intended ephemerality of their negotiated hold on our computers is why we say we only "visit" them. In fact, it might be more accurate to say web pages are guests we host on our computers for a short time.

<!--
So, yeah, I'm crazy about the web. Crazy enough to work for Mozilla and turn down every other job offer over the years because the mission aligns so well with so many of my favorite things.

## The freedom of the open web (for makers)

There is no other successful system like this on the planet. No other system for delivering content and software that is this open and free of gatekeepers deciding what we can publish. No other system where you are free to choose from many agents to operate on your behalf, independent of the publishers whose creations you visit.

There's no app store, no review process, no adult supervision. You can make the most amazing or terrible things and - short of legal action or government intervention - no one can really stop you as long as you're paying the hosting bill.

In fact, even though I wrote that browsers are agents acting on their users' behalf - they're historically weak advocates. In general, they do what web pages ask, with a few exceptions for safety and security. So, today's open web offers the balance of control largely to publishers.

No one will stop you from [building a web page][theverge] that fires off hundreds of requests, chews up mobile data plans, and makes a CPU melt through the casing - all while ushering in dozens of global entities to observe every aspect of behavior that can be gleaned from keystroke, tap, and scroll.

Of course, you can also emulate old computers [to make running classic software linkable and embeddable][jsmess].

Or you can craft [a gorgeous existential narrative about luminous beings][enough].

Or you can create new [hats and weapons for a video game][trovecreations], sharing your work [as a link][troxel] to a 3D modeling tool.

<!--
Or share videos of [a cat wearing a shark costume cleaning the kitchen on a roomba][sharkcat].
-->

Or you can write [a blog that lands you in an Iranian jail][iranjail].

## The technology of the open web

As far as I can see, [Parkinson's law][] tends to apply to the web. Browser vendors are working flat out to keep up and occasionally innovate. Meanwhile, for every improvement to capacity, someone works out some new thing to consume it. The trajectory of today's web is sometimes quite [Sisyphean][sisyphus] - push that performance boulder up the hill this year just to see next year's industry standard practice tip it right back down again.

Still, looking at it from my historical context, it's astonishing that this

## Blame is easily misdirected

Flash crashed? Blame Firefox.

Slow web page? Blame Firefox.

If Mozilla's lucky, maybe you take it up a level and blame your laptop or phone instead of Firefox. Believe it or not, many folks don't know what a browser is. They lack the motivation to make space in their heads for that knowledge. (Having most of *my* head taken up by this stuff, I certainly can't blame them.)

So, the user agent or the device gets the blame. It's right there in front of you. All the hustle it's doing behind the scenes is obscured by layers of technology and jargon. It's nearly impossible for any sane person to wrap their head around all the responsible parties involved in any given web page.

The blame rarely falls on web publishers and the organizations with whom they've made deals. Sure, us web nerds complain all the time, but that's just noise. Busy normal people just want that thing to stop spinning so they can eat a burrito and read about who Donald Trump pissed off this time.

## Better performance is coming

## Time for better funding models

So I guess it's easier to start fresh with a new kind of user agent that's on the side of the money from day 1.

Snarking aside, this is not entirely unreasonable. Again, [there ain't no such thing as a free lunch][tanstaafl]. In fact, folks like [Ted Nelson][micro-liberation] and [Jaron Lanier][free-info] have been saying for years (and decades) that the free-of-charge web is failing itself and all of us. (For what it's worth, [I made fun of Ted Nelson & Xanadu][xanadu-fun] once upon a time. But, since then I've read more about his work and realize how off base I was.)
