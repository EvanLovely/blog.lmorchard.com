From [Brock's Blog](https://blog.brocktice.com/2014/10/21/armed-citizens-revolution-and-costs/):

> What I find fascinating is that Bundy and his well-armed supporters were able to raise the cost of the government’s intervention enough to get them to back down. The government can be viewed as a massive, powerful monolith, that doesn’t need the approval of the people to do what it wants, but that’s a mistaken view. The federal government is made of real people with consciences and scruples. Furthermore, if it loses enough public support, and support from a significant portion of the military, it may even leave itself vulnerable to being overthrown. Therefore it’s in the interests of the government and its members not to do things that will widely be perceived as pernicious and overreaching.

This was in response to [a tweet of mine](https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/522957862793134080). You should go
read his post. The rest of this started as [a comment](https://blog.brocktice.com/2014/10/21/armed-citizens-revolution-and-costs/comment-page-1/#comment-81095)
in response.  If I end up posting this draft here, it will appear
with some additional editing and links and maybe a few more words.

My thinking is that the political, racial, and socio-economic issues make way
more of a difference in Bundy vs Ferguson than the presence of weapons.

## At the Bundy Ranch

Those folks at Bundy's ranch were on the right side of privilege. The guns were
props; the real weapons were politics. Like Brock wrote, "shooting
Bundy and his supporters over some cattle grazing on public lands would have
been widely condemned". I doubt the authorities were as afraid of an exchange
of gunfire as they were of the fallout afterward. Those militia folks
<i>knew</i> they'd make for terrible press and horrible politics if anyone on
either side got shot. 

Somehow, I don't think the Founding Fathers imagined American Militias would
win by <i>making tyranny look & feel bad</i>. And yet, I
think that's all the Bundy ranch standoff could accomplish. Seriously, had these
folks been a real threat, they would not have been handled gently: At worst, there
would have nasty things falling on them from the sky. At best, the militia
would have been picked up & arrested individually once the standoff had
dispersed. Politics didn't make any of these options appealing.

Brock wrote, "What I find fascinating is that Bundy and his well-armed
supporters were able to raise the cost of the government’s intervention enough
to get them to back down." But, did they really back down? Months later, I
don't think Bundy has gotten much of what he wanted after the party at his
ranch broke up. It got some folks' attention and changed the conversation a
bit. But, there are many ways to do that without throwing a State-tolerated
armed tantrum.  Politics are the only thing that will change the situation,
long-term.

## In Ferguson

On the other hand, the authorities in Ferguson had no qualms about rolling up
in military-style vehicles, deploying a sniper or two, and dousing a mostly
unarmed crowd of protesters and apparent bystanders in backyards with
less-lethal weapons. The authorities in Ferguson were better armed <i>with
politics</i> - which are against the notion of dark skinned folks gathering in
numbers with dangerous weapons. The authorities didn't expect any significant
fallout - and since then, very few of their members <i>have</i> seen serious
repercussions.

Could you even imagine the police response, had some of those black folks shown
up openly-carrying anything close to the gear white folks brought to the
protest at the Bundy ranch? My cynical guess is we'd see the deployment of
teams trained to deal with urban warfare overseas and the whole local
population handled like insurgents.

## On giving the authorities pause

It's a political decision to pretend a group of men with personal weapons is
viable resistance. They're only very slightly more dangerous than folks holding
signs, on the absolute scale. The authorities at the Bundy ranch were capable
of so much more force - it was only political consequences that stopped them.

The more that folks even <i>entertain</i> the notion that armed resistance
<i>could ever</i> be an effective option - the less they have to think about
what they could do to affect change that involves long, boring, non-violent
conversations as an alternative to shooting their neighbors. 

An armed citizenry <i>can</i> raise the cost of government abuse, but only so
far. At some point, some State official will consider the cost within budget
and decide it's worth going on a spending spree. At that point, I guarantee
even armed citizens will be unable to outspend the government in which they
should have been active adult participants the whole time.

I can see the value of having a threshold that gives petty abusers
pause. But how does that work with a gun? Can I use my handgun or AK-47 to
resist a cop asserting asset forfeiture on my wallet during a highway stop? How
about repelling a SWAT team who trolls called on me while I was streaming a
game on Twitch?

In the case of rounding up Japanese-Americans, I could almost guarantee you
that armed resistance on their part during wartime would have led to them
treated as confirmed enemies on our own soil. Not saying that putting Americans
in camps was in any way right, but shooting back would have been so much worse.
I'm thinking genocide worse.

And, in Ferguson, I'd assume that the appearance of hundreds of armed
protestors in sympathy with the locals would have led to a disproportionate
escalation after a pause. What would those protestors look like, and how would
their politics fare?

## On American armed rebellion in general

This is my view on armed rebellion in America: If it gets to that point, we've
all failed miserably. Every single one of us. We should have been talking to
each other more effectively well beforehand. Politicians should have been
working with each other, rather than grandstanding for the fans back home. And
all of us citizens should have gotten out of the habit of seeing political
parties as sports teams in need of an unalloyed win.

Despite a lot of the rhetoric
out there, we really have no King or Dictator. All we have is ourselves and our
neighbors. Granted, these days, money allows some of our neighbors to shout
much louder than they have any fair right to, and that's a problem in my mind.

But, seriously, against *whom exactly* would you be rebelling with arms? And
*with what system* would you replace what we have that wouldn't end up in the
same or worse mess all over again?

Because, in an armed rebellion, no one will win. I highly doubt, once the smoke
clears, that whatever has replaced America will be anything anyone really
wants. Though I'm sure many would disagree, we got lucky with the first Civil
War. A second one would wreck us for good.

## Conclusion

I'm not really against personal gun ownership, but I think the notion that
you're actually going to make any lasting stand against the US government with
literal firepower is **childish**.

To me, it's a wish to cut (shoot?) the Gordian knot of actually having to talk
to people and grind through the complex and largely unrewarding work of
persuasion & compromise. It's seeing the world as a football game of opposing
sides and demanding an absolute win. But, that's not how you build a working
civilization - and I like to say <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/parting.htm">I am a member of a
civilization</a>.

In fact, I think my whole point is this: "The federal government is made of
real people with consciences and scruples. Furthermore, if it loses enough
public support, and support from a significant portion of the military, it may
even leave itself vulnerable to being overthrown. Therefore it’s in the
interests of the government and its members not to do things that will widely
be perceived as pernicious and overreaching."

Again, the guns are props. The real power is perception & persuasion - i.e.
politics.
