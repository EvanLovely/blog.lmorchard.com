This is my blog. There are many others like it, some of them mine. This one is
also mine.

## TODO

* Hack gulp-awspublish to upload many files in parallel
* Switch from Swig to Nunjucks because it's a Mozilla project hooray
* Add [NYT emphasis.js](https://github.com/NYTimes/Emphasis) to post pages
* Add some TOC generation in JS
