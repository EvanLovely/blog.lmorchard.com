## TODO

* Quick gulp task to produce a new boilerplated post
* Generate .json files per-{tag,date,post}, rather than monolithic indexes
* Dynamic "related posts" feature using tags and per-tag .json files
* Dynamig "related links" feature using tags and pinboard.in API
* Better archives page with calendars and not just a big list of everything
* Hack gulp-awspublish to upload many files in parallel
* Switch from Swig to [Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) because it's a Mozilla project hooray
* Add some TOC generation in JS
